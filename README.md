# Profit Prophet

A simple task/profit tracker to help independent contractors bid their work

### Tech used:
**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node, TailwindCSS, Docker**

### Front-End
The front end was built with React as a framework and tailwindCSS for style.

### Back-End
The backend follows MVC principals and was built using Node, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB. Passport-local, Express session and Bcrypt were used for authentication.

### Deployment 
The site was originally deployed on heroku. However since heroku is nolonger supporting their free teir, the site has since been moved to fly.io for hosting. fly.io utilizes the docker build system for hosting.

## Optimizations
This is a long term project with many future optimizations planned.

- I would like to add a hero section with general stats about all entries
- I would like to add images to the entries, so contractors can keep pictures of completed work
- I would like to add per hour profits to tasks so you can see an average hourly rate for each task.
